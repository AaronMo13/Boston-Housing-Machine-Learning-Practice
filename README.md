# Boston-Housing-Machine-Learning-Practice
Here we firstly analyse the Boston Housing dataset to ensure it is ready to be used to create models, and then we experiment with many machine learning models to attempt to predict the housing prices. The aim here is not to try to make the best model, just to experiment with some available models.
